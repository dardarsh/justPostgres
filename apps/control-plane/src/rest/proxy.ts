/**
 * The public face of a project's REST API.
 *
 * PostgREST is published on the host's loopback interface only, so this proxy
 * is the only route in from anywhere else. That is worth the hop: the API
 * cannot be found by scanning the machine from the network, it can be turned
 * off centrally by flipping one row, and adding TLS or rate limiting later is a
 * change in one place rather than per project.
 *
 * Two addressing forms, the same fallback shape as the database router:
 *
 *   /rest/<project-ref>/<table>        always works
 *   <project-ref>.api.example.com/     needs wildcard DNS, nicer to use
 *
 * The proxy deliberately does **not** interpret the Authorization header. The
 * JWT is PostgREST's business, and revalidating it here would mean two
 * implementations of the same check that could disagree — the worse kind of
 * security bug, because it looks correct from both sides.
